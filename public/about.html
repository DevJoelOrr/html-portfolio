<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Joel Orr, I was raised in Maryville, TN and enjoy all things computers! I married the love of my life in January of 2017 and now have three beautiful children! </p>

<p>Computers have always been an interest of mine. I started out on the hardware side repairing PCs, tablets and phones. I have always been interested in Web Development and in 2024 I finally decided to start learning. I was accepted into a coding bootcamp called App Academy, but after considering the cost I decided to withdraw my enrollment and went down the self-taught path. I have loved every moment of it and look forward to growing in this skill set!</p>
